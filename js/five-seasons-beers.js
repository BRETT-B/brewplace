Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.",

Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).",

It is also dosed with a british ale yeast late in primary fermentation to \"clean it up a little\" and then an Abbey yeast is added for secondary fermentation. The base malt is all German Pilsener and Munich Malt (as is the typical practice of most of the high quality Belgian brewers of pale beers) with a bit of red winter wheat thrown in for body and mouthfeel and just a touch of coriander for the finish. We use a little Belgian Light Candi Sugar and a little Special B Malt to add to the Belgian character. Five mash rests are employed to improve the clarity, pH and distribution of sugars. And, four hop additions are made in the boil using a combination of German, Styrian and Czech Hops. This beer gets considerably better with about six months to a year under its belt. 5 Seasons will be serving it throughout this period, slowly meting out the kegs on a monthly basis to ensure it lasts until next year's batch is ready.",

					"description": "This beer style is characterized by a distinct sweet maltiness and a chocolate-like character from roasted malt. Estery and phenolic elements of this Weissbier should be evident but subdued. Color can range from copper-brown to dark brown. Dunkel Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated, and hop bitterness is low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Usually dark barley malts are used in conjunction with dark cara or color malts, and the percentage of wheat malt is at least 50 percent.

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).
