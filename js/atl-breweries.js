This milestone not only exemplifies their continuing commitment to amazing craft beer, but also signals a shift in focus for the brewery towards more innovative recipes and concepts.\r\n\r\nHeaded up by a small group of impassioned beer lovers including head brewer Garett Lockhart, Red Brick is determined to lead the charge in the south, putting out excellent beers such as \"Hoplanta\" IPA and the upcoming winter release \"Sacred Cow\" chai milk stout. They also take time to push the limits of brewing with the \"Brick Mason\" series, which the staff sees as their continuing masterpiece. Highlights from this series include \"The Lost Years\" old ale, \"Black-Eye Rye\" American black ale, and the most recent release \"20th Anniversary\", a 10% Imperial stout that was aged in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels. Early accolades have already compared it to the hallowed KBS.\r\n\r\nThe future keeps looking brighter and brighter for this brewery, and the next couple years will see them growing and experimenting with diverse styles, collaborating with fellow breweries, implementing a new barrel program, and continuing to raise the bar for themselves in all aspects. After all, craft beer isn't just a product; it's a journey.",

Eric and Eddie began their relationship working in the same company in Atlanta, GA. Both shared the passion of home brewing and soon realized that home brewing together on the weekends became something they always looked forward to. Following long discussions about attempting our dreams we decided to share our passion and start Pontoon Brewing Company. The “Pontoon Lifestyle” came to be as the idea of escaping the daily stresses and relaxing on a pontoon boat. For those unaware, a Pontoon boat is commonly known as a slow moving party platform; it can’t go far and can’t go fast so might as well drink.\r\n \r\nThe Pontoon Brew Crew is currently brewing our beers with our friends and the very talented folks at Thomas Creek Brewery in Greenville, South Carolina with hopes of opening our own brewery in Atlanta, GA in the near future. In the collaborative spirit of home brewing and wanting to develop beer for beer drinkers, we would love to hear your thoughts.",

As we got more engrained in the industry and more people started showing up to brew with us, beer quickly became more than just a weeknight hobby.\r\n\r\nWe spent almost 5 years perfecting our Eye Patch Ale and Drafty Kilt Scotch Ale before bringing them to market. Years of minor tweaks, arguments over hop profiles, and experiments with different brands of base malts are poured into every glass that we brew.",

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)",

			"description": "Eventide is a start-up brewery in Atlanta, GA. It was founded on the idea that great beer doesn’t have to be complicated and good beer should be enjoyable. We are also focused on bringing sessionable craft beer to everyone. The biggest trend, and subsequent impediment, in craft/micro brewing is the almost obsessive need to make the biggest, hoppiest, strangest beer possible, which is great for advancing the boundaries of what can be done with beer but does not satisfy a daily thirst. We pride ourselves on making great beer, with all the flavor one could want, that people will actually want to drink whenever and with whatever. Again, great doesn’t have to be complicated.\r\n\r\nAnother of our fundamental ideas is that brewing is free, and should be open. So, with this in mind, we will share as many of our “secrets” as possible with everyone so that they too can make great beer at home. If you ever have questions please reach out, we are more than happy to share what we know! (Seriously, we will talk about brewing and all of it’s components for hours…love this stuff.)",
