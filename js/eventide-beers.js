				"description": "Our rendition of the Dry Irish Stout follows with the traditional light body with dark flavors, however, we incorporated a little more ABV into the style and moved the dark flavors up to balance it out. The recipe has just a hint of Coffee and a bit stronger finish with the same, if not better, drinkability that has made this style a favorite among beer drinker for generations. Our target for this modified Dry Irish style is for the typical stout drinkers that want something a little more American. In house we like to call it the Dry American Stout.",

					"description": "Dry stouts have an initial malt and light caramel flavor profile with a distinctive dry-roasted bitterness in the finish. Dry stouts achieve a dry-roasted character through the use of roasted barley. The emphasis of coffee-like roasted barley and a moderate degree of roasted malt aromas define much of the character. Some slight acidity may be perceived but is not necessary. European hop aroma and flavor should be low or not perceived. Dry stouts have medium-light to medium body. Fruity esters are minimal and overshadowed by malt, high hop bitterness, and roasted barley character. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be very low or not perceived. Head retention and rich character should be part of its visual character.",

Add an orange slice to give it a citris zest and you’ve got a great beer for those hot summer days or a little ray of sunshine on a cloudy day. We like it and know you’ll love it.",

These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent or present at very low levels. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.",

Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.",

				"description": "For those who are not familiar with the Kölsch style ale, it is only legally allowed to be produced in Cologne, Germany. That is why, when you do see it, it is mostly “Kölsch Style” instead of just “Kölsch”. We understand Cologne, it is a truly good style of beer with all the light flavors that you would expect in a pilsner and only half the trouble to make. We are only troubled by the fact that because you regulated this style most of the rest of the world hasn’t heard of it. We are here to change that, whether you like it or not.  We took the traditional “Kölsch Style” and worked it up a bit with some special hop additions. We did not go noble with the hop profile but instead took it in a direction that paired better with the bready flavor of the pilsen and the touch of wheat grains that make up the back bone of this brew. This style is perfect on those hot summer days, but it’s is also so refreshing that it is great anytime. So good in fact that it may coin the phrase “Eventide Style Kölsch”, and don’t worry Cologne, we’ll let you call it that too.",

Named for the wife of one of our founders (she’s the one who requested it), the “Red Headed Haley” is our interpretation of an American amber ale. Brewed with multiple malts and hops, we worked to bridge the gap between a Belgian and American amber. The result was an immensely drinkable beer with notes of both styles and new flavors unfamiliar to both (we may have discovered quarks, anyone know what one tastes like?). This has had the benefit of bottle conditioning and aging which has, almost surprisingly, only improved it. We can’t wait for you to taste it.",

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
