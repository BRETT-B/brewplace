				"description": "A robust porter brewed with lots of chocolate malt and roasted barley. This gives the beer its nearly black color and coffee and dark chocolate flavors. These flavors are then tempered with the use of flaked oats which provide an almost creamy texture to the beer. The 7.7% abv is deceptive but is not completely unnoticed.",
