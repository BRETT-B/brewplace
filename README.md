# Brew.place

A responsive single page application (SPA) that allows the user to search through local breweries. Not only is the application a resource to find out specific information on any given beer in the area, but it also allows the user to store beers that they like in a "Favorite Beers" list. Additionally, the site offers a wealth of general beer knowledge in what we call "Beer 101" in case you're too buzzed to figure out some terminology.
